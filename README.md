# User-Authentication
### Context
In order to access the application, users must be registered and authenticated during login. Only authenticated users will be allowed to log in. Develop a Spring Boot application with a User entity containing attributes such as userId, userName, userPassword, and userAddress. Implement authentication using JWT to ensure secure access and protect user data.
